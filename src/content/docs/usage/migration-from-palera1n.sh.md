# Migration from palera1n.sh

Before starting the new jailbreak, if you used tethered, you will have to restore rootfs before proceeding.

## Tethered

1. Go into your palera1n folder, or clone a new one if needed
2. Run `./palera1n.sh --tweaks <your iOS version> --restorerootfs`
   1. Use `sudo` if on Linux
   2. Make sure [usbmuxd is restarted](run-on-linux.md#restart-usbmuxd)
3. Go to the usage guide for your platform

Please keep in mind that 16 GB devices are not supported as of now.

## Semi-tethered

You don't need to do anything, just go to the usage guide for your platform.
